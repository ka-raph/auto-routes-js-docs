# AutoroutesJs - Documentation

**AutoroutesJs** is a lightweight, easy to use, configurable & fast router for your web app! Get the SPA experience with vanilla JS, HTML and more with no hassle nor steep learning curve due to huge frameworks.

**AutoroutesJs** supports JS and HTML files for templating out-of-the-box, but it is also easily configurable to use other file formats, such as Markdown (which is powering these docs).
